ðŸš€ Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze patterns and predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques and provide actionable insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard. By leveraging HR analytics, we empower organizations to better understand why employees leave and take proactive steps to improve retention.

Key Features
 1. Data Analysis Dashboard- High-Risk Employees
 2. Based on attrition prediction probability.
 3. Highly Satisfied Employees
 4. Sorted by job satisfaction levels.
 5. Real-time filtering (Top 10 or All entries).
     
 Attrition Prediction Form
 
 Custom form input to simulate employee details.
 Predicts whether the employee is at risk of attrition.
 Displays a risk score with an intuitive success/warning message.
